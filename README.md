Welcome to our Final Year Project. This tool allows you to view the most frequently talked about features in user reviews and the reviews sentences which contains these features for a selected product. 

To get started, you will have to crawl an E-commerce website for user reviews. In our tool we have crawled flipkart. 

crawler.py crawls the Product Selection page forproduct links.

To add new products first add the name of the product and then the link of the product at the end of <filename> in the format shown below:

Product Name (If product name is more than one word, leave a space in between)
Product Link

Running crawler.py would prompt you to enter 2 numbers the 1st number the the start no and the 2nd number is the end number of the product page. Enterting 1 and 10 would result in crawling 10 product links.

in productInfocrawler.py similary you would be prompted to enter two numbers there the two numbers are the start and end limit of the no of products details to be crawled.
